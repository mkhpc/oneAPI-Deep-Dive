## Intel oneAPI Series - Deep Dive (Live Demo and Hands-on): oneAPI and DPC++ on Intel DevCloud

The Intel oneAPI Toolkits based on Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) - modern C++ and SYCL - allows developers to develop, optimize, and deploy algorithms for accelerated computing across XPU architectures (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and other accelerators).

## What will you learn:

* Articulate how oneAPI can help to solve the challenges of programming in a heterogeneous world.
* Understand the DPC++ language and programming model.
* Profile a DPC++ application using Intel VTune Profiler on Intel DevCloud.
* Learn how to migrate CUDA code to Data Parallel C++ using the Intel DPC++ Compatibility tool.

## Agenda 

* Overview of Intel oneAPI and Data Parallel C++ 
* Introduction to the Intel DevCloud
* Setup of Intel DevCloud and JupyterLab Environment
* DPC++ Program Structure 
* Demonstration of Intel VTune Profiler on Intel DevCloud 
* Demonstration of Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool on Intel DevCloud
